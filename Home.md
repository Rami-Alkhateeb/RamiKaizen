## Business Lines

KAMS operates in several business lines and these are listed as below:  
* Unit Management
* Property Management
* Owners Association Management
* Value Added Services

### Unit Management
KaizenAMS unit management service is targeted at the landlords who own a portfolio of properties/assets. This line of business consists of tasks such as, leasing, managing, maintaining and organizing the service providers and suppliers of the assets in the portfolio.

A portfolio can be defined as a grouping of tangible assets such as units, buildings, projects, etc.

The main purposes of systemizing the unit management can be summarized as below:
* Provide a better service to our clients.
* Provide a better service to tenants of the units managed.
* Provide a solid system to KaizenAMS operations team to manage the units as a means to reach success in the previous two points.

### Property Management
KaizenAMS property management service aims to take the hassle away from the owner by ensuring provided services encompass all aspects of running a profitable property.

In order to reach this aim, MasterPlan system should be able to provide:
* Document Control
* Maintenance Management
* Facility Management
* Reporting

### Owners Association Management
An owners association (OA) is an organization in a community or condominium that makes and enforces rules for the properties and their residents. Those who purchase property within an OAâ€™s jurisdiction automatically become members and are required to pay dues, known as service fees. 

An OA is a non-profit organization.

KaizenAMS OA management services include:
* Advisory on financials including budget preparation
