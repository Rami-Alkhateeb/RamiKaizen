# Definition

The project is the main focal point for all Business Lines.  
A project has one or more cost centers, units, buildings and ledgers.

# Properties
Project entity corresponds to “project” collection in the database which has the following fields:

## Units
This array is a limited replica of the units stored as separate objects in the FireStore database. Only the below fields of the whole unit field list will be stored here:
* id
* name
* type
* building
* cost_center
* portfolio
* area
* floor
* status

## Contacts
This array is a limited replica of the contacts assigned to the project. Only the below fields of the contacts will be stored here:
* id
* name
* surname
* function
  * Please note, the function logic was originally designed with the [Contact Function](Contact-Function) entity and [Contact Reference](Contact-Reference). This functionality is now moved to the inline arrays now.

## Documents
This array is the array of document definitions as described in [Document](Document).  
There is no need to have a separate Document collection, all the document details will be stored in the relevant objects in the Firestore.

## Notes
This array is the array of the note definitions as described in [Note](Note).  
There is no need to have a separate Note collection. All the note details will be stored in the relevant objects in the Firestore.

## Ledgers
As described in [Ledger](Ledger) a project can have multiple ledgers. Namely;
* Project Ledger
* Owners Association Ledger

So this object holds the information for the ledgers of the project. The object structure is as follows:

```
{
    project_ledger_shards: [
        {id: 'shard_id_1', has_available_space: false }, 
        {id: 'shard_id_2', has_available_space: false }, 
        ..., 
        {id: 'shard_id_n', has_available_space: true }
    ],
    oa_ledger:  [
        {id: 'shard_id_1', has_available_space: false }, 
        {id: 'shard_id_2', has_available_space: false }, 
        ..., 
        {id: 'shard_id_n', has_available_space: true }
    ]
}
```

# Processes

## List
All the projects in the system are recorded in the project table in the system database, irrespective of the business line.

![image](uploads/0a6e78d9386a58d7f83f8e75938b8c79/image.png)

Listing of Projects will be done in a tabular format with the following columns, represented from the corresponding fields from the database table:
* Name: Name of the project.
* Business Line: Lines of business where the project is assigned to by abbreviations.
    * PM: Project Management
    * OA: Owners Association Management
    * UM: Unit Management
* Address: Address of the main project.
There are additional action items on the Unit listing screen, listed below:
* New Project: This button opens a modal dialog described in the below “Creating a Project” section.
* Search: Search is done on the names and/or addresses of the projects.
* Filter: 
    * UM Filter: Shows only the unit managed projects.
    * PM Filter: Shows only the property managed projects
    * OA Filter: Shows only the owners association managed projects
    * Address Filter: Can filter based on the country and city

## Delete

A project can be deleted from the listing projects screen of the system. However, project deletion is not expected to happen normally and should require admin privileges. 

If the user has the necessary privileges, when the ellipsis button is clicked and the “Delete” option is selected from the listing projects screen, a confirmation dialog should confirm with the user and the system should run the below queries on the system database upon confirmation:
* Delete units of the project.
* Delete cost centers of the project.
* Delete buildings of the project.
* Delete the project tuple.

If the user doesn’t have the necessary privileges, system should show a warning message informing the user.

## Create

![image](uploads/e25e2fa14e3eabaff90f4ead6acbce92/image.png)

When “Create” button is clicked on the “Listing Projects” screen, a modal dialog opens and asks only for the “Name”, isPM, isOA and isUM fields. 

Two buttons on the modal screen should exist. 
* Create: Creates the project. Following the creation takes the user interface to the newly created project details screen explained below.
* Cancel: Cancels the creation and rolls back to projects listing.

Project creation on the backend database should be completed as a transaction with the below steps:
* Insert tuple into the project table
* Insert tuple into the ledger table with the type "Project Ledger" and project as the last inserted id from the previous step.
* Insert tuple into the ledger table with the type "OA Ledger" and project as the last inserted id from the previous step.

Project details user interface employs a tabbed interface. Each tab and functionality is described in the following subsections.
