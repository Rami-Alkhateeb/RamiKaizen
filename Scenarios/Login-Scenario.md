System users should have an entry point to the system.  
Naturally this entry point is the login screen on both mobile and web applications.

Below is the design of the login screen:

If the password is wrong, system should show the below screen:

Since a user can have multiple personas, below screen is introduced to the user if the user have multiple roles:

An example of this multiple persona situation is that, a landlord can be a tenant at another property at the same time. Or a service provider can also be an owner to one of our managed units.

So, if there are multiple personas, we should have this intermediary screen for the user to interact with the system with each login.

Once the persona is selected it should proceed to the correct view of the application. 

For the users with only one persona, this page will not be shown and skipped.
