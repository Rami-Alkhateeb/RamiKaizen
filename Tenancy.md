Leasing tab uses an accordion UI interface to display the future, current and past leases. 

Tenancies are descending ordered by end date.
By default, when the tab is visited, currently active lease details are expanded in the accordion UI and user can click to collapse and expand the individual accordion panels.

Attachments will be listed using Listing Documents process, and can be added for a tenancy using Uploading Documents process.

Notes will be listed using Listing Notes process, and can be added for a tenancy using Creating Note process.

Generate Lease Agreement button should be enabled for the Lease if the tenancy contract is not already uploaded to the system.  Lease agreement document will be generated as per the Ejari Template.

On the Leases tab of the unit details UI, “New Lease” button opens a modal screen asking for start and end dates of the new tenancy. Both dates should provide the date picker UI component for data entry. If the cancel button is clicked, the process is cancelled. If the OK button is clicked, the system creates a new record in the tenancy table of the system database with the provided dates of the tenancy and mark the tenancy as a new tenancy. Once the database insert operation is complete, the system takes the user automatically to the new tenancy details to be edited.

## Archive

On the Leases tab of the unit details UI, “Archive” button on the current lease screen asks for confirmation from the user and updates the deleted_at field of the tuple with the current timestamp.

## Assign Current
On the Leases tab of the unit details UI, if the current state of the system UI shows a “new lease”, an additional button “Assign Current” is displayed to the user. Click of this button requests confirmation from the user and changes the type field of the tuple to current lease in the system database as well as changes all the other tenancy tuples assigned to the current unit as archived.
