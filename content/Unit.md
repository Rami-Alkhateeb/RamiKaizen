# Definition

Unit is the primary building block of all the business lines KaizenAMS operates in. 

## Unit Properties
All the units in the system are recorded in the units table in the system database, irrespective of the business line. 

Unit entity corresponds to “unit” table in the database which has the following fields:

## Ancestors Analysis of a Unit

In different business lines, a unit is accounted under different hierarchies.

Unit Management Business Line: A unit is assigned to a building and also to a portfolio. As a result, only “building” and “portfolio” fields should be populated in the database tuple.

Property Management Business Line: A unit is assigned to a building. As a result, only “building” field should be populated in the database tuple.

Owners Association Management Business Line: A unit is assigned to a building and also to a cost center. As a result, only “building” and “cost_center” fields should be populated in the database tuple.

If a unit belongs to more than one business line, in this case, the unit assignments will be done on a union basis.

## Unit Processes

### Unit Assignment

A unit can be assigned to a portfolio, cost center or other entities using this process. 
The user interface is defined as above.

### Unit Listing

Unit listing will be done in a tabular format with the following columns, represented from the corresponding fields from the "unit" table in the system database:

* Unit No: Text field. Click action on an item on this column takes the system to the details of the unit.
